In this project, we explored the simplified model of the top squark decays, namely the process: $pp \rightarrow \Tilde{t}\Tilde{t^*} \rightarrow t \Bar{t} \Tilde{\chi^0_1}\Tilde{\chi^0_1} \rightarrow b\Bar{b}jjl\cancel{\it{E}}_{T}$ by simulating this process through MadGraph, Pythia and Delphes, across four different mass parameters for the top squarks and neutralinos. Three of which were sitting very close right outside the exclusion curve, in black, in Figure \ref{fig:limits}, and the other sitting well within the curve. \\

We used a machine learning algorithm known as xgboost to discriminate the signal and background events, followed by a simple statistical analysis using the approximate median significance (AMS). The three mass parameters outside the curve produce AMS values of 0.1, 0.31 and 0.6 suggesting that the background-only hypothesis for both discovery and upper limits cannot conclude definitively. In contrast, the data from within the exclusion curve resulted in an AMS value of 2.8 associated with a relatively low SBR of 15.7\%, given that the integrated luminosity is 137 $\text{fb}^{-1}$. This is a high AMS value, and by using a smaller luminosity value at 35.9 $\text{fb}^{-1}$, we observe this to reduce to AMS=1.37 with the SBR remaining relatively low at 15.6\%. This shows that indeed, this parameter $m_{\Tilde{t}} = 750$ GeV and $m_{\Tilde{\chi}_1^0} = 1$ GeV is excluded from searches. \\

We also turned to a high-dimensional data visualisation known as a guided tour to observe the patterns within the data as well as what qualities of the signal-like and background-like events made our classifiers perform poorly for such points. The most contributing variables were shown to be $\cancel{\it{E}}_{T}$ and the azimuthal component ($\phi$) of the $\cancel{\it{E}}_{T}$ and the charged leptons. The signal-like events showed a large spread in energy and angular dependence in most directions except for values closest to the $x$-direction orthogonal to the beam axis. The background-like events were distributed close to the $x$-direction orthogonal to the beam axis that we can imagine the charged lepton and missing energy to form a cone-like separation in the final states. As expected, the difference in energy for the events is the key contributor to differentiate signal and background. \\

In the future, it would be interesting to continue the analysis, particularly with the guided tour using more exotic variables such as the \textit{stransverse mass} to observe the contribution of such variables as we have done so well studied variables. We also hope to implement the guided tour as an analysis tool in helping us understand different processes for new exotic particles not limited to the simplified model in this project.
