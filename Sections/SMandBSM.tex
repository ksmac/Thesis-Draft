\section{The Standard Model}
The Standard Model (SM) is made up of three generations of spin-$1/2$ \textit{fermions} as fundamental particles, spin-1 \textit{gauge bosons} and the spin-0 \textit{Higgs boson}. The interactions of the fermionic matter are mediated by the gauge bosons which are well represented by Quantum Field Theory (QFT); these correspond to the three fundamental forces - electromagnetism, the weak force, and the strong force. Unfortunately, the remaining fundamental force, gravity, is yet to be understood at the quantum level. The Higgs, rather the Higgs field, is responsible for the particles acquiring their masses. \\

The fundamental particles are composed of \textit{leptons} and \textit{quarks}, shown in Table \ref{tab:SMFerm}. Each of the three generations of quarks has an up-type and a down-type quark categorized by their electric charges ($+2/3 \text{ or } -1/3$), and the leptons are either charged or neutral, with the neutral components are known as \textit{neutrinos}. The up-type quarks are the \textit{up}, \textit{charm} and \textit{top} quarks, and the down-type quarks are the \textit{down}, \textit{strange} and \textit{bottom} quarks. These quarks exist in a bound state known as \textit{hadrons}, except for the top quark that decay before \textit{hadronisation}, and can never be observed directly. Hadrons are categorized into mesons or (anti-)baryons; Mesons consist of two quarks - a quark-antiquark pair, and (anti-)baryons are made up of three (anti-)quarks. Proton and neutrons are some examples of baryons, and pions and kaons are mesons \cite{thomson2013modern}. These fundamental particles differ greatly in mass, with the first generation being the lightest and sequentially becoming heavier for the second and third generations. The first generation of elementary particles represents the basic building blocks of the low energy Universe \cite{thomson2013modern}. \\

The SM is governed by a combination of complex gauge symmetries, $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, with each symmetry described by its corresponding gauge bosons shown in Table \ref{tab:SMBos} \cite{thomson2013modern}. It comprises of four vector bosons in the form of \textit{gluons}, \textit{photons}, \textit{Z bosons} (neutral) and \textit{W bosons} (electrically charged). The gluons mediate the strong force, or strong interactions, described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), binding quarks into hadrons for example. The three remaining gauge bosons are a result of the Higgs mechanism \cite{higgs1964broken, englert1964broken}. The Higgs mechanism involves the Higgs boson, rather the Higgs field - a doublet comprised of a neutral and a charged field component, that acquires some vacuum expectation value (vev). This produces a physical Higgs and three charged and neutral massless Goldstone bosons that are `eaten' by the gauge bosons through electroweak\footnote{The electroweak interaction describes both electromagnetism and the weak interaction as a unified force  ($SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$) in the weak scale \cite{thomson2013modern}.} symmetry breaking. The $SU(2)$ weak gauge bosons $W$ and the $U(1)$ gauge bosons $B$ through the Higgs mechanism provide terms that form the gauge bosons in Table \ref{tab:SMBos}; a mixture of $B$ and $W^0$ that become the massless photon and Z boson that is roughly 91GeV/c$^2$ \cite{tanabashi2018review}, and $W^1 \mp iW^2$ that become the W boson that is roughly 80GeV/c$^2$ \cite{tanabashi2018review}. These terms will be relevant again when we discuss a supersymmetric model. Before considering supersymmetric models, there is an extended theory to the SM known as the Two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM).  The Higgs sector in the 2HDM has two doublets opposed to the one in SM; the up-type Higgs ($H_u$) and the down-type Higgs ($H_d$) that contain both neutral and charged components \cite{2HDM}. In the 2HDM, the number of degrees of freedom doubles to eight, leading to 5 massless scalars including a SM-like Higgs boson, shown in Table \ref{tab:SMBos}.  \\

\subsection{The top quark and its decay}
Amongst the SM particles, the top quarks and their decays will correspond to our background events. The top quark has a rest mass of $m_t\approx175\text{GeV/c}^2$ (we will express mass and energy in natural units $c=1$ hereon) and an electric charge of +2/3$e$ \cite{tanabashi2018review} making it the only known elementary particle in the SM to be heavier than the Higgs boson. The top quark is produced predominantly through gluon-gluon fusion and it almost always decays through the weak interaction into a pair of bottom quarks and W bosons. Through the weak interaction, the W boson decays into either a charged lepton-neutrino pair or a pair of quarks and quarks that form hadronic jets. The possible decay modes are given in Figure \ref{fig:topdecay}. \\

%The theoretical predictions of top quarks and the bottom quark was established in 1973 by Kobayashi and Masakawa to explain charge-parity (CP) violation in some meson decays \cite{griffiths2008introduction, kobayashi1973cp}. Experimental evidence for the bottom quark, the generationally paired particle to the top quark, was found at Fermilab in 1977 \cite{herb1977observation}. Nearly two decades later in 1994, the top quark was discovered at the Tevatron with a centre-of-mass energy\footnote{The Centre-of-Mass energy, denoted as $\sqrt{s}$, is a Lorentz invariant value such that $s=\Big( \sum\limits_{i=1}^2 E_i \Big)^2 - \Big( \sum\limits_{i=1}^2 \overrightarrow{p_i} \Big)^2 $. Note that $c=1$ and each $i$ represents the protons in the beam.} of $\sqrt{s}=1.8\text{TeV}$ through the process $p\Bar{p} \rightarrow t\Bar{t}$ \cite{abachi1994search, coll1994evidence, abachi1995observation}.

\section{The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model}
The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is one of many extensions to the SM that helps to explain new physics beyond the SM. The MSSM particle content duplicates the SM particle content thus keeping extra particles introduced to its minimum. A supersymmetric transformation that yields the same quantum numbers as that of the SM retains the symmetry groups of the SM discussed in the preceding subsection \cite{aitchison2007supersymmetry}. The fermions and bosons in the SM shown in Tables \ref{tab:SMFerm} and \ref{tab:SMBos}  have \textit{superpartners}; the supersymmetric counterparts to each particle in the SM as seen in Tables \ref{tab:SUSYspart} and \ref{tab:SUSYinos}. By convention, the SM particles and their superpartners are distinguished by a tilde. \\

The superpartners to the SM fermions are called \textit{squarks}, \textit{sleptons} and \textit{sneutrinos} whereas the superpartners to the bosons in the SM end with an ``-ino" e.g. \textit{gaugino}. The `symmetry' in supersymmetry is the symmetry between fermions and bosons, meaning that the fermions in the SM are bosons in the MSSM, and vice versa \cite{martin1997supersymmetry}. Tables \ref{tab:SUSYspart} and \ref{tab:SUSYinos} illustrate that the number of new particles introduced is kept to a \textit{minimum} \cite{aitchison2007supersymmetry}. This symmetry, however, would require that these MSSM particles have the same masses as their SM counterparts. We know that this is not true because such particles have not been observed so far in collider experiments. The symmetry must be broken at some high energy scale in an unknown way, allowing these particles to acquire much heavier masses than their SM counterparts that are unobservable with current collider experiments' energies. \\

\end{table}
%with three neutral components ($\Tilde{h}^0$, $\Tilde{H}^0$ and $\Tilde{A}^0$) and two charged components ($\Tilde{H}^\pm$).
In the MSSM, a new global symmetry \textit{R-parity} is required. This stems from the violation of fundamental quantum numbers in the SM known as baryon ($B$) and lepton ($L$) numbers, now unconserved in the MSSM. Strong experimental constraints for $B$- and $L$- violating processes support the need for a method for these numbers to conserve. R-parity is therefore assumed to be a conserved quantum number that resolves this issue, given by Equation (\ref{eq:RParity})
\begin{equation}
    P_R=(-1)^{3(B-L)+2s}
    \label{eq:RParity}
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the spin of the particle. This symmetry conveniently separates SM particles and their MSSM superpartners in a way that the SM particles have $P_R=+1$ (even R-parity), whereas the sparticles all have $P_R=-1$ (odd R-parity) \cite{martin1997supersymmetry}. In MSSM, the conservation of $R$-parity results in supersymmetric events as pair-produced events \cite{aitchison2007supersymmetry}. \\

With the new scalars in Table \ref{tab:SUSYinos}, the MSSM introduces dark matter candidates known as \textit{neutralinos}. These particles are a mixture of the neutral components of the MSSM gauginos (excluding the gluino) and Higgsinos as shown in Figure \ref{fig:SUSY}. The four neutralinos denoted $\Tilde{\chi}_i^0$ where $i=1,2,3,4$ have a mass hierarchy of $ m_{\Tilde{\chi}_1^0} < m_{\Tilde{\chi}_2^0} < m_{\Tilde{\chi}_3^0} < m_{\Tilde{\chi}_4^0}$ \cite{martin1997supersymmetry}. The lightest of the four, $\Tilde{\chi}_1^0$, is thought to be the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) which is stable, supporting the theoretical properties of a proposed dark matter in cosmology. This assumption holds only when \textit{R-parity} from Equation (\ref{eq:RParity}) is conserved \cite{martin1997supersymmetry}. This means that the two-body decay of $\Tilde{\chi}_i^0$ is pair-produced with other supersymmetric particle. The charged gauginos and Higgsinos mix to form the \textit{charginos}, shown in Figure \ref{fig:SUSY}, that will always decay. In collider experiments, the `detection', or measurement, of these neutralinos rely on the missing energy of reconstructed SUSY event, much like the SM neutrinos. \\
